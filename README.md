A React-Native app for the "Tower's of Hanoi" puzzle

Solve the tower puzzle that has stumped great minds for centuries! 

The goal of the game is to move the tower of discs from one peg to another. You can only move one disc at a time, and you cannot place a larger disc on top of a smaller disc. 

You can choose how many discs you want in your tower. Challenge yourself to solve it using the fewest number of moves possible, or try to solve the puzzle as fast as possible. View your achievements for each number of discs.
